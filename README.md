# 2048clone
A clone of 2048, built as an exercise in both making a complete set of game mechanics and working in Javascript.

This is my first time building a "complete" application using HTML/CSS/Javascript, and it's likely to be pretty rough around the edges. I wanted to focus on just getting it done. But feedback/pull requests/whatever is welcome!
